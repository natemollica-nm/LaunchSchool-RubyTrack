# Discussion
# Finding the documentation for #step can be a bit difficult
#   since there are different types of number classes in ruby.
#   Even a Google search will probably turn up a lot of false
#   leads. If you need a method that works with numbers, the
#   following classes are worth searching through:
#   1. Integer
#   2. Float
#   3. Numeric
#   4. Math
# Integer and Float inherit from Numeric. Numeric is
#   basically the superclass of all numeric types,
#   while Math is a module that supplies a lot of number
#   crunching functionality. Choosing the right documentation
#   to look at is difficult, so, for now, be aware that you
#   may have to look in all these locations.

# Starting with version 2.4.0, Ruby no longer uses
#   Fixnum and Bignum; all integer values are Integer objects.

# As it happens, you can find #step described in the
#   Numeric class documentation. #step has 4 calling
#   signatures, but we're interested in the first listed.
#   In this version, #step takes two keyword arguments
#   (also called named arguments), :by and :to (keyword
#   argument names are symbols). This shows up in our method signature:

# step(by: step, to: limit) { |i| block } → self
# The argument named :by is a "step" value, while
#   the argument named :to is a limit. The text below
#   the signature shows that the "step" value indicates
#   how much to increment the index by with each iteration,
#   while "limit" is the largest value; if the index
#   exceeds this value, the loop exits.

# We can also see that #step takes a loop in this
#   first form, and that it will execute the block
#   for each value in the iteration.

# Given all this information, we can see that the
#   code will print 5 on its first iteration, 8
#   on the second iteration, and then quit because 11 > 10

5.step(to: 10, by: 3) { |value| puts value }
